### Validation

In this repository are several HTML files. Each one contains the complete code necessary to have a "valid" webpage, but something is missing from each one. Using [the HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea), correct the HTML code to satisfy the validator and describe what's missing from each one in an HTML comment.

### Additional Questions

For this section create an `answers.txt` file and write your answers there.

1. What does the `title` tag do?
1. What information do images need, and why?
1. What's the difference between `head` and `body`?

### Bare Minimum Boilerplate

Based on the messages from the validator, write the bare minimum HTML you need to have a "valid" webpage in a file called `minimum.html`.
